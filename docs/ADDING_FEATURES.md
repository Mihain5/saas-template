# Adding Features Guide

Learn how to expand your SaaS with new features using AI assistance.

## Feature Development Workflow

1. **Plan** → 2. **Design** → 3. **Build** → 4. **Test** → 5. **Deploy**

## Planning Your Feature

### Questions to Answer First

Before building, clarify:
- **What** does this feature do?
- **Who** will use it?
- **Why** do they need it?
- **How** will they use it?
- **When** will they use it?

### Example Feature Plan

```
Feature: Team Comments

What: Users can comment on any item
Who: All team members
Why: Better collaboration and communication
How: Comment box under each item
When: During project work
```

## Designing Your Feature

### Option 1: Describe in Words

Tell AI exactly what you want:
```
Add a comment system where:
- Users can add comments to any task
- Comments show user name and timestamp
- Users can edit/delete their own comments
- Comments are ordered newest first
- Include @mentions to notify users
```

### Option 2: Share Visual Design

1. Create mockup (hand-drawn is fine!)
2. Save as image
3. Tell AI: "Build this feature based on my design"
4. Attach the image

### Option 3: Reference Existing Apps

```
Build a comment system similar to:
- Notion's page comments
- Linear's issue discussions
- Slack's thread replies
```

## Feature Implementation Process

### Step 1: Update PRD

Add to your `prd.txt`:
```
NEW FEATURE: [Feature Name]

Description: [What it does]
User Story: As a [user type], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
Success Criteria:
- [How to know it works]
```

### Step 2: Tell AI to Build

Use this template:
```
Add [feature name] to the application:

Requirements:
[List all requirements]

Database needs:
[Any new tables/fields]

UI/UX:
[How it should look/work]

Integration:
[How it connects to existing features]

Please build this incrementally and test as you go.
```

### Step 3: Test the Feature

After AI builds:
1. Check live deployment
2. Test all scenarios
3. Try edge cases
4. Verify on mobile
5. Check with different user roles

## Advanced Features

### Real-Time Updates

```
Make [feature] real-time using:
- Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Instant UI updates
- Conflict resolution
- Offline queue
```

### AI-Powered Features

```
Add AI capability:
- Smart suggestions
- Auto-categorization
- Sentiment analysis
- Predictive text
- Natural language processing
```

### Integrations

```
Integrate with [service]:
- OAuth connection
- Data sync
- Webhook handlers
- Error handling
- Settings page
```

## Database Considerations

When adding features, consider:
- **New tables**: What data to store?
- **Relationships**: How does it connect?
- **Permissions**: Who can access?
- **Performance**: Will it scale?

## UI/UX Best Practices

### Keep It Consistent
- Use existing components
- Follow current patterns
- Match color scheme
- Similar interactions

### Make It Discoverable
- Clear navigation
- Helpful tooltips
- Onboarding tour
- Documentation

### Design for Everyone
- Accessible (ARIA labels)
- Mobile-friendly
- Fast loading
- Error states

## Testing Your Features

### Manual Testing
1. Happy path (normal use)
2. Edge cases
3. Error scenarios
4. Different roles
5. Mobile devices

### Ask AI to Test
```
Test the [feature] by:
- Creating test data
- Trying all actions
- Checking permissions
- Verifying data saves
- Testing error cases
```

## Performance Optimization

If feature is slow:
```
Optimize [feature] performance:
- Add loading states
- Implement pagination
- Cache results
- Lazy load data
- Optimize queries
```

## Rolling Back Features

If something breaks:
```
Remove [feature] safely:
- Preserve existing data
- Clean up database
- Update UI
- Maintain backups
```

## Feature Flags

For gradual rollout:
```
Add feature flag for [feature]:
- Enable for specific users
- Percentage rollout
- Easy on/off toggle
- No code deployment needed
```

## Getting User Feedback

After deploying:
1. Add feedback widget
2. Track usage analytics
3. Conduct user interviews
4. A/B test variations
5. Iterate based on data

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Building everything at once
✅ Build incrementally

❌ Skipping mobile testing
✅ Test on all devices

❌ Ignoring edge cases
✅ Plan for errors

❌ Over-engineering
✅ Start simple, enhance later

❌ Not considering scale
✅ Plan for growth

## Feature Prioritization

Build features in this order:
1. **Core functionality** (must-have)
2. **User requests** (high demand)
3. **Competitive advantage** (unique)
4. **Nice-to-have** (enhancement)
5. **Future vision** (long-term)

## Remember

- Start small and iterate
- Test thoroughly before announcing
- Get user feedback early
- Document new features
- Update help/onboarding
