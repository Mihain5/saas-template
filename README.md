### Phase 3: Build Your SaaS (1-2 hours)

#### Step 8: Prepare Your Project Information

1. **Create Your PRD (Product Requirements Document)**
   - Create a file called `prd.txt` in the `.taskmaster/docs/` folder
   - Describe your SaaS idea in plain English
   - Include: What it does, who it's for, main features
   - See [PRD Template Guide](docs/PRD_TEMPLATE.md) for examples

#### Step 9: Start Building with AI

Copy and paste this complete prompt into Cursor's chat:

```
I want to build my SaaS application using the template. Here's what I need you to do:

1. First, check Task Master to see the current project status
2. Read my PRD document in .taskmaster/docs/prd.txt
3. Review any design files in .taskmaster/design/
4. Parse the PRD to generate initial tasks
5. Set up the database schema in Supabase based on the requirements
6. Configure user roles and permissions in Clerk
7. Build the application features one by one, following the task list
8. Test each feature as you build it
9. Deploy changes to Vercel after each major feature

Please work through this systematically, updating task status as you go. Ask me if you need any clarification about the requirements.

Remember:
- Everything should be deployed to the cloud (no local development)
- Use MCP tools for all operations (don't show me code)
- Update Task Master after completing each task
- Test features in the live Vercel deployment
```

#### Step 10: Build Process

The AI will now:
1. Read your requirements
2. Create a task list
3. Build your database structure
4. Create your pages and features
5. Deploy everything automatically

You just need to:
- Answer any questions the AI asks
- Test features as they're built
- Provide feedback on what to adjust

### Phase 4: Launch Your SaaS (30 minutes)

#### Step 11: Final Configuration

1. **Set Up Webhooks**
   - The AI will configure these automatically
   - You'll need to verify they're working in Clerk dashboard

2. **Configure Email Settings**
   - Follow [Email Setup Guide](docs/EMAIL_SETUP.md)
   - Customize email templates in Clerk

3. **Set Up Payment Processing (Optional)**
   - Follow [Stripe Setup Guide](docs/STRIPE_SETUP.md)
   - Add products and pricing

#### Step 12: Connect Your Domain

When you're ready to use your own domain:
1. Follow the [Custom Domain Guide](docs/CUSTOM_DOMAIN.md)
2. This is typically done after initial testing
3. Takes 24-48 hours for DNS to fully update

#### Step 13: Launch Checklist

Before going live:
- [ ] Test all features with multiple test accounts
- [ ] Verify multi-tenant isolation works
- [ ] Check email notifications
- [ ] Test payment flows (if applicable)
- [ ] Review security settings
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts
